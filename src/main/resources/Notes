GraphQLQueryResolver : Our resolver class(@Component) should implement this class when we perform get operations
GraphQLMutationResolver : Our resolver class(@Component) should implement this class when we perform update or post

*our class implement both above resolvers if we have controller doing both mutation and query(POST/Get operations)
* If you are making use of @QueryMapping / @Mutation mapping in resolver class then you don't need to
implement GraphQLMutationResolver and GraphQLQueryResolver

Note : If you want to make graphql call from MS1 to MS2 then in MS1 you have to make webclient call
and pass query as argument and in MS2 you should have configured resolver methods along with it.
